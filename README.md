# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my implementations of the projects from the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), which guides learners through building a computer system from the ground up.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Project 1 - Boolean Logic**: Implementation of basic logic gates.
- **Project 2 - Boolean Arithmetic**: Construction of arithmetic logic units.
- **Project 3 - Sequential Logic**: Design of sequential chips.
- **Project 4 - Machine Language**: Writing simple programs in machine language.
- **Project 5 - Computer Architecture**: Building the CPU and memory systems.
- **Project 6 - Assembler**: Developing an assembler for the machine language.
- **Project 7 - VM I: Stack Arithmetic**: Implementing the first part of the virtual machine.
- **Project 8 - VM II: Program Control**: Completing the virtual machine implementation.
- **Project 9 - Compiler I: Syntax Analysis**: Beginning the construction of the compiler.
- **Project 10 - Compiler II: Code Generation**: Finalizing the compiler.
- **Project 11 - Operating System**: Developing basic operating system services.

## Tools

The `tools` directory contains software tools provided by the Nand2Tetris course, such as simulators and assemblers, to assist in testing and running the projects.
